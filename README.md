- Hello, I'm Joseph Curtis.
- I'm currently a student at Louisiana State University, pursuing a bachelor's in computer science, with a focus on software engineering and web programming.
- As of May 2023, my experience is primarily in Java and JavaScript, and I am currently studying web development.
- Many of the things I upload here will be college assigments, but I'll be adding some personal projects that I'm particularly proud of once I become more skilled.
