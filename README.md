- Hello, I'm Joseph Curtis.
- I'm currently a student and employee at Louisiana State University, pursuing a bachelor's in computer science, with a focus on software engineering and web programming.
- As of January 2024, my software engineering experience is primarily in Java, and my web development experience involves JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and .Net.
- Most of my repositories here will be a mix of college assignments and personal projects.
-   Some assignments are not publically visible due to their reuse, but can be shared when requested.
