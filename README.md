- Hello, I'm Joseph.
- I'm currently a student at Louisiana State University, persuing a bachelor's in computer science, with a concentration in software engineering.
- As of August 2022, I primarily have experience with Java, and am currently learning C and C++.
- Many of the things I upload here will be college projects, but I may add some personal ones that I'm particularly proud of once I become more skilled.
